Please note that the refactoring process is a complex task that requires an understanding of the entire application's architecture and requirements. I have made some improvements and cleaned up the code, but further optimization may be needed depending on the specific context and application design.



Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php

First of all, I have refactored the "index" function by introducing some global variables that should be defined in the configuration. Additionally, I replaced some of the if-else statements with ternary conditions to make the code more concise and readable.

In the "distanceFeed" function, there was a significant mess, which I have resolved by removing the messy code and extracting it into a separate function. This was done to improve code cleanliness and make it more understandable.

----------------------------

2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

In the "bookingRepository" code file, I have made several changes. Instead of using array(), I replaced it with simple braces []. Additionally, I utilized the compact function, which returns an associative array containing variables and their values.

Moreover, I replaced some of the if-else statements with ternary statements to make the code more concise and easier to read. Where I felt that separate functions would be beneficial, I created separate functions to reduce code messiness and enhance maintainability.

=====================================

My thoughts about the code:
What I observed from the code is that it follows old practices, and we should adopt the latest practices and use the most up-to-date code. However, I am not aware of the PHP version this project is running on.

There are certain improvements that can be made to the code. For instance, we should create generic functions where we are repeatedly using the same code. Instead of duplicating the code, we should rely on these generic functions to keep the code clean and easily readable.

By adopting the latest practices and implementing generic functions, we can enhance the maintainability and readability of the code.

===================================
Test Cases:

To write test cases in PHP, you need to install PHPUnit, which is a testing framework for PHP. You also need to set up some configurations for PHPUnit to work effectively.

Due to time shortage, I am writing a test case for user create or update method for an example
